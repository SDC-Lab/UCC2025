# 🌍 Federated Learning Tutorial with Flower & EuroSAT  

This folder demonstrates how to build a **hierarchical federated learning (FL) system** using:

- **50 simulated satellite clients**  
- **5 randomly assigned clusters**  
- **Cluster-level FedAvg + Global FedAvg**  
- **EuroSAT satellite image dataset (64×64 RGB)**  
- **PyTorch + Flower (`NumPyClient` interface)**  

All code is designed to run directly inside **Google Colab**.
