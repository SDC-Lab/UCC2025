# This folder includes the following files to compute the visiting pattern of satellites with the GS and its sample visualization.

**UCC_Tutorial_Matlab.m** file is an example to compute the visiting pattern of satellites with the GS and the list of satellites that can be selected as master satellites. 

**Visualization.mp4** is visualization output of sample scenario with following parameters:
Constellation: Walker Delta, Number of LEO satellites: 40, Number of orbits: 5, Number of LEOs per Orbit: 8, Inclination 70 degree, Ground Station: Canberra ([-35.40139, 148.98167]), Altitude: 600 Km

We used Matlab's **Satellite Communications Toolbox** to compute the visiting pattern of satellite. More information can be found in:
